AI NOTE: This document is a cut and past from the backend. Not all code will follow this
architectural pattern yet. Some adaptation may be needed for frontend specifics.
// ✓ Independence: Domain logic doesn't depend on frameworks or tools

HEXAGONAL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (Ports and Adapters Pattern)

The hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters) organizes code
to isolate the core business logic from external concerns. This makes the
application more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to change.

CORE PRINCIPLES:

1. Dependency Rule: Dependencies point inward toward the domain
   Infrastructure → Adapters → Application → Domain
   
2. Ports: Interfaces that define how the application communicates
   - Primary/Driving Ports: How external world uses our application (use cases)
   - Secondary/Driven Ports: How our application uses external world (repositories)

3. Adapters: Concrete implementations of ports
   - Primary/Driving Adapters: HTTP controllers, CLI, GraphQL (inbound)
   - Secondary/Driven Adapters: Database repos, external APIs (outbound)

BENEFITS:

✓ Testability: Domain and application can be tested without infrastructure
✓ Flexibility: Easy to swap databases, frameworks, or external services
✓ Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns
✓ Independence: Domain logic doesn't depend on frameworks or tools
✓ Replaceability: Adapters can be replaced without changing core logic

DEPENDENCY FLOW:

External Request → Primary Adapter (HTTP Controller)
                → Application Use Case
                → Domain Entity/Service
                → Secondary Port Interface (Repository)
                → Secondary Adapter (PostgreSQL Repository)
                → Database

TESTING STRATEGY:

- Domain: Unit tests (pure functions, no mocks needed)
- Application: Unit tests with mocked ports
- Adapters: Integration tests with real infrastructure
- End-to-End: Full request-response cycle tests
